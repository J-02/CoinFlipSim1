# CoinFlipSim

## Running
can be ran with `python CoinFlipSim.py` (i think) \
if you have issues update java

## Instructions
pick the number of flips, sims, and what wagers to sim for \
click run and the progress bar will show you how its going

## Bugs
if to slow click reset and you will be able to do another (it will put an error in the console but will still run fine) \
dont click start twice lol if you do can just reset

## Find Percentile
you can input a drawdown amount and find the percentile of that drawdown data from a bootstrap simulation of the already simulated data \
this essentially tells you what percent of sims had that max drawdown

## BackStop
can do the inverse with putting in a percentile like 5 (5%) to get the drawdown for that percentile that could be used as a 
backstop

## Plots
as you graph it will add plots to the violin plot but to see just one and the stats for a sim select from the drawdown menu

any other questions or bugs let me know
